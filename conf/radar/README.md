# Radar Sample platform

The Radar Sample Platform is designed to demonstrate a typical AI use case 
involving the processing of radar location events. The platform ingests 
simulated radar data and makes predictions about the types of vehicles detected.

This project is ideal for understanding how AI can be applied in real-time data 
processing and analysis in the context of vehicle detection and classification. 

## Before to start

This platform requires a model artifacts, to install the model simply execute:

```sh
./bin.uploadArtifacts.sh radar
```

## Start the application

From the configuration view, simply start the radar folder.
